# Exams Report of Students

This repository contains all the code i have written to carry out below steps and problems given to me as Project.

### Instructions given
#### Steps to organize data
Step 1: Make two separate linked lists for male and female students containing group, math score,
reading score, writing score and parental level.

Step 2: Now make two stacks based on the average marks obtained by male and female students (lowest on
bottom, highest on top) using linked lists in step 1.

Step 3: Develop separate queues for various parental level of students containing average marks and gender
of students from both stacks made in step 2.

Step 4: Develop separate queues for various groups of students containing average marks and gender of
students from both stacks made in step 2.

#### Problems to solve
Problem 1: How to find the best average marks of group A and D using data from step 4.

Problem 2: Which gender has performed better at various parental level of students from step 3.

Problem 3: Which group has performed better at all parental level levels of students.

Problem 4: What is the median of average marks obtained by male and female students


### What i've used
I have used different Data Structures such as Linkedlist, Stack, Queue to complete this project.
It has been a great learning journey for me overall.
